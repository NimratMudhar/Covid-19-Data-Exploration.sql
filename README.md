## Project Overview

This repository contains a SQL script for exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the spread of the virus, its impact on different regions, and various statistical trends. The SQL script retrieves and manipulates data from a provided dataset, and the results are presented through both textual summaries and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains COVID-19 data, including information about confirmed cases, people vaccinated, time periods, and deaths in different regions. The dataset was taken from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) The data is structured and can be loaded into a SQL database for analysis. 
 - [CovidDeaths.xlsx](https://github.com/NimratMudhar/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx)
 - [CovidVaccinations.xlsx](https://github.com/NimratMudhar/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx)

## SQL Queries

The `Covid Data Exploration.sql` script consists of SQL queries designed to explore and analyze the COVID-19 dataset. The queries cover a range of topics, such as:

- Basic data retrieval and exploration
- Aggregation and summarization of COVID-19 statistics
- Comparison of case numbers across regions and timeframes
- Identification of hotspots and trends
- Calculation of growth rates and percentages

## Results and Visualizations

The project generates textual summaries and visualizations to communicate the findings of the data exploration. The outputs include:

- Summary statistics tables
- Comparative charts and graphs
- Growth rate calculations
- Important trends and patterns

The results aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 data and contribute to a broader awareness of the pandemic's impact.
